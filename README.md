# Coding exercise

Fork this repository and commit and push all your work to the fork.  It is always best to do lots of small regular commits.

Create an API using Python.  The API should have two endpoints.  One that, when given two numbers, adds them together and returns the sum.  Another that, when given two words, joins them with a dash and returns the result.  If you have any questions, pick an answer and then document it.

You can use any Python framework or libraries that you want to.  There should be instructions on how to install and run it.  The API should ideally be platform independent but it will be evaluated on a recent MacOS machine.

Preferably there should be a couple of example tests that show that it works.

The code should be neat and error free.  We use `black`, `isort` and `flake8` to keep our code neat.  You don't have to use this, but you may find it helpful.  You can install them by running: `pip install -U black isort flake8`.  We have included configuration in this repo.  You can run them using:

    black .
    isort .
    flake8 .

We never expect people to already know how to do things.  Google and Stackoverflow are your friends.

Things we will be judging the submission on:

    * Ability to provide instructions on how to run your solution
    * Ability to do things you didn't previously know how to do
    * Ability to explain what decisions and assumptions you have made
    * Correctness and completeness of solution
    * Code quality
